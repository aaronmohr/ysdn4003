            <h4>Overview</h4>
        
            <p>Founded in 2007, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/" target="_blank">Soundcloud</a> is an online platform for musicians to easily upload and share their music. Targeted primarily at lesser known, independent musicians and producers, the platform was intended to provide an online community in which musicians have the opportunity to upload their music while also connecting with other musicians worldwide.</p>
            
            <p>Where Soundcloud strives is the ways in which it makes music sharing easy and accessible. Users are allowed 180 hours of free upload time, helping young musicians gain a platform to upload their music without having to pay or go through some sort of middle man (such is the case with large scale platforms such as iTunes or Spotify). Soundcloud also helped to create a massive online community of global musicians, accredited to the success of many artists over the years.</p>

            <h4>Visual Analysis</h4>
            
            <p>Visually, Soundcloud has maintained a very clean, well designed platform that has help set the standard for online music streaming. With the use of simple UI and built-in streaming capabilities, Soundcloud quickly became the ‘Youtube’ of music, influencing how people listened to and discovered music.</p>
            
            <p>The visual design tends well to the mobile user, reducing the clutter of some of the additional features on the desktop app. While the mobile app has no way of uploading music, it still provides users with the opportunity to listen, find and save new music.</p>
            
            <p>Much of Soundclouds recognizable style comes from its actual music player. Unlike most other music based apps, Soundcloud’s built-in music player uses unconventional design elements to create a more unique, simplified playback experience. The use of the audio waveform visualization and a large focus on album art has become a sort of trademark of Soundcloud’s design, helping it to differentiate itself in the market.<p>
            
            <p>In recent years, Soundcloud has been in a bit of a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/21/15999172/soundcloud-business-model-future-spotify-streaming" target="_blank">dying phase</a>. As large, monetized streaming services such as Spotify continue to grow, Soundcloud is left trying to adopt to the new market and is ultimately failing. But where Soundcloud failed was not necessarily in its use of design but rather the ways in which it changed values of the product in relation to its target user. Like any company, Soundcloud needed to monetize their product and make money, but unfortunately their efforts were quite unsuccessful as compared to other streaming services.<p>
