            <h1 class="brief">Wireframes</h1>
            
            <div class="header">
                <img src="../img/wireframes/wires-exploration.png">
            </div>
            
            <p>My approach started by further identifying my goals with the project and finding ways to visualize those concepts and ideas. I wrote out some of the questions that I hoped to answer and address in my application as a way to help pave the way for my visual thinking. From there, I developped a generic set of low-fi wireframes that got my initial ideas out onto the page and could be used as a reference throughout the wireframing process.</p>
            
            <p class="brief">After re-evaluating my research and ideating further, I decided that I want my application to act as a way for musicians to share their works in progress and monitor their music making process. This would help influence inspiration amongst this community as well as provide these users with more insight into the hidden art of music making.</p>
            
            
            <h4>Concept I - Personal Library</h4>
            
            <div class="two-column">
            
                <div class="left">
                    <img src="../img/wireframes/wires-concept-1.png">
                </div>

                <p class="brief right">My first concept focused around the idea of musical journaling. Essentially, this idea revolves around the ability to record and organize brief song sketches. This is a process that most musicians typically go through when song writing, thus the goal with this approach is to make this process as quick, easy and efficient as possible.</p>
            
            </div>
                
            <h4>Concept II - Collaboration</h4>
            
            <div class="two-column">
                <div class="left">
                    <img src="../img/wireframes/wires-concept-1.png">
                </div>

                <p class="brief right">The second concept revolves more around the idea of influencing collaborationg amongst musicians. Based around the same principle of the initial process of songwriting, this approach would allow musicians to share their early works in progress and gain feedback from other musicians in the community. This would also allow likeminded musicians to interact with one another with the hopes of inspiring some sort of creative collaboration amongst users.</p>
            
            </div>    
                
            <h4>Concept III - Process Sharing</h4>
            
            <div class="header">
                <img src="../img/wireframes/wires-concept-3.png">
            </div>
            
            <p>My third concept acted as a way to bring all of these ideas together in a simplified manor. This approach would focus on the primary user first, acting as a way for musicians to easily record, save and organize their song 'sketches'. From there, users can organize their audio files into various projects as a way to track their progress throughout the span of the song writing process. While still including the ability to interact with other users on a basic level, this approach acts as a way to track and share the creative process.</p>
            
            <div class="header">
                <img src="../img/wireframes/wires-hifi1.png">
            </div>
            
            <p>The main screen of the app would act as a basic audio recorder. The goal here is to make the song ideation process quick and easy. Users should be able to open the app and instantly record any sort of idea right away before it is lost. From there, artists will have the ability to save and organize all of their song files to easily access them at a later date.</p>
            
            <p class="brief">Additional features of this approach could include the ability to follow other users and access some sort of user based timeline. This would act as a way to watch how other musicians are working and gain inspiration from their works in progress. I also feel as if the intergration of various outsourced music platforms would help benefit the process. By including links to final versions of song ideas that users have posted, people would be able to hear the song writing process from start to finish.</p>
            
            <h4>Next Steps</h4>

            <p class="brief">As I continue to sketch out possible wireframing concepts I find that I need to focus further on the best way to approach this visual system. My goal is to create a general mapping system as a way to determine all of the necessary features and flows within the app. From there, I will continue to refine the actual screens in order to accurately portray my vision for my click through prototype.</p>
