            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            
            <p class="brief">With the shift in online culture, many musicians rely on social media and other various online platforms to share their work and connect with other like-minded individuals. In a climate where remote collaboration is more popular than ever, this causes some concerns for music producers who are simply looking to gain some insight and tips towards their music making process. Because the music making process is somewhat of a hidden art, it can be hard for electronic musicians to connect and find others who work within their same practice.</p>
            
            <h4>The Concept</h4>
            
            <p class="brief">This app will focus on creating a community in which electronic music producers can openly share their progress and collaborate with one another. The idea resides around collective creativity, opening up the creative process to other producers as a way of influencing collaboration and new ideas. This mobile app will allow unheard musicians to tell their own ‘story’ with likeminded individuals and help progress their skill as artists. This will in a way open the door to the unknown world of music production and give these artists a better sense of belonging.</p>
            
            <h4>Goals &amp; Objectives</h4>
            
            <p class="brief">The primary objective of this product is to make the act of making and sharing music easier amongst music producers as a way of enhancing their skills. The idea is not necessarily focused around the final product of sharing songs, but more so on opening up the creative process as a way of gaining feedback and opening up your ideas for collaboration. Beit with sharing drafts or streaming studio sessions, the goal is to connect producers in a place that they are already familiar with – the studio.</p>
            
            <h4>Audience</h4>
            
            <p>This app will be targeted towards musicians working primarily within the world of music production. The idea is to open up a hidden process and allow for an outsiders perspective on their works in progress. The focus will be primarily on adults between the ages of 16-30, with a more dominant focus on music producers who work within the realm of electronic-based music.</p>
