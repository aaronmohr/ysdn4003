            <h1 class="brief">Motion Videos</h1>
            
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            
            <p class="brief">After refining my high fidelity screens and designing [almost] all of the necessary screens, I worked on translating my designs into a motion based prototype. The process proved to be a bit more difficult than I had anticipated, as I was not overly familiar with any one prototyping tool. In the end, I made all of the prototypes within Principle. This allowed me to bring my concept to life quiet well, but also introduced some minor issues within the animation due to the limitations of the program.</p>
            
            <h4>Record Flow</h4>
            
            <div class="header">
                <img src="../img/motion/record.gif">
            </div>
            
            <p class="brief">The record flow showcases the simplicity of the recording process within the app. The idea was to keep the user interface free of any uncessary elements and use big, bold components to ease the user through the process.</p>
            
            <h4>Browse Flow</h4>
            
            <div class="header">
                <img src="../img/motion/browse-1.gif">
            </div>
            
            <p class="brief">The browse flow demonstrates the user flow between the record and browse page. I wanted to play with the animation of the actual record button and find ways to have it translate easily accross pages.</p>
            
            <h4>Review Flow</h4>
            
            <div class="header">
                <img src="../img/motion/browse-2.gif">
            </div>
            
            <p class="brief">This flow is representational of the process of playing a recorded file. Once selected from the browse page, the user has the ability to play, monitor and edit the file.</p>
            
            <h4>Collections Flow</h4>
            
            <div class="header">
                <img src="../img/motion/collection.gif">
            </div>
            
            <p class="brief">This animation is an exploration of the possible animation state that would occur when selecting and opening a collection. I wanted to incorporate the large folders and colour assingments across the two states so I focused on making the transition fluid and quick.</p>
            
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            
            <p class="brief">Translating my concepts into motion pieces proved to be quite helpful in terms of allowing me to re-evaluate my app as a whole. I found a few small continuity issues that were addressed throughout the process and found new ways that I can continue to improve my final designs. My goal is to continue refining my designs and motion pieces in order to implement them within my final microsite.</p>
