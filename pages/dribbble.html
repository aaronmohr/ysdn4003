            <h4>Overview</h4>
        
            <p><a href="https://dribbble.com/" target="_blank">Dribbble</a> is an online community for designers to share the projects that they are working on. With the intention of gaining feedback and outside critiques, Dribbble has also connected designers worldwide and, for better or for worse, changed the way that designers share their work online.</p>
            
            <p>Dribbble is based around the idea of ‘shots’; short snippets of designers on-going projects. The original intention was to inspire online critique and feedback, but as of late the website has become more of a secondary portfolio showcase for designers and design agencies. While this is not necessarily a bad thing, it has taken away from the applications original intentions.</p>
            
            <div class="screens">

            <h4>Visual Analysis</h4>
            
            <p>Initially started as a web application, Dribbble has translated its online experience into a useful mobile product. The product itself is quite well designed, but feels disconnected from Dribbble’s well established online brand. There are many of Dribbble’s trademark elements within the app, but it still seems to shy away from the original product, almost making it feel like an unofficial third party application.</p>
            
            <p>Branding aside, the Dribbble app still offers a wonderful array of easy to use functionality. The browser is simple and intuitive, using a two-column grid making the designs easily recognizable without taking up too much screen real estate. Upon viewing specific projects users are greeted with a beautiful full width display accompanied by all of the shots information including number of likes and the implemented colour palette.</p>
            
            <p>The navigation system follows basic, standard design practices but works very well. The app is incredibly easy to navigate, with built-in smart search features and an easily accessible upload feature, allowing users to upload designs directly from their phone.<p>
            
            <p>Dribbble has become one of the most widely known design communities in the industry. The concept is simple and well executed, showcasing the ways in which more specific creative communities can come together in an online format to help influence one another.<p>
