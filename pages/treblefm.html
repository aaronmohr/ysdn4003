            <h4>Overview</h4>
        
            <p><a href="https://www.treble.fm/" target="_blank">Treble.fm</a> is an app designed specifically to connect musicians together and create an online community that influences musicians to meet up. Treble’s focus is on networking and helping musicians find band mates or collaborators. Each user is allowed to define their ‘role’ and from there the app works as a sort of dating app for musicians in which service calls are sent out and answered. Be it studio sessions or production assistance, the goal is to set likeminded individuals up with one another and produce new music collaboratively.</p>
            
            <p>The main demographic of Treble.fm is focused on young, aspiring musicians who are looking to further their career by connecting with members of that industry. With soundcloud and youtube integration, Treble is unlike any standard streaming app and more focused on bringing musicians together within the physical world to work with one another.</p>

            <h4>Visual Analysis</h4>
            
            <p>Treble’s interface is surprisingly well designed. Unlike other apps that fall under this category, it stands out while still making use of proper design practices. The use of easy navigation, well-executed iconography and bold colour choices help to generate a genuinely enjoyable and fresh feeling experience.</p>
            
            <p>The integration of location tracking and filters help to make Treble much more successful for its intended usages. These features help the user to track down the musicians that would benefit their specific needs rather than scrolling through long lists of random users. The inflicts an ease of use and makes the overall experience much quicker.</p>
            
            <p>Artist listings make it easy to review and respond to specific postings which have been posted in Treble’s Bulletin section. These work as sort of job positing’s in which musicians will put out calls for their specific needs with the hopes of connecting with other qualified individuals. While the Bulletin section offers great value, it is currently riddled with spam and requires some sort of filtering in order to ensure a more effective and useful application.<p>
            
            <p>The concept behind Treble.fm is really quite well done. It brings the networking aspect of the music industry into the forfront and offers young musicians a truly useful experience. With continued growth, it is clear to see that this application could certainly have an impact on the way that young musicians interact with one another and form networking connections.<p>
