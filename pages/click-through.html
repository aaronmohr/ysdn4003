            <p>After completing my intial wireframes, I decided to try and take a step back and re-evaluate my overall concept. I realized that my prior ideas had all been quite broad and felt that it was better to approach my general concept by focusing on a more niche/specific target. Thus, I decided that my app would be approached as a sort of progress tool for musicians. The idea is to make recording song drafts and tracking ideation progress as simple and easy as possible. This would allow for musicians to capture the 'story' of how their songs are made.</p>
            
            <p>In focusing in on a more specific market, I realized that I needed to re-approach the general architecture that I am developing. This lead to me coming up with a basic structure that revolves around three main pages: record, browse and projects. These respectively allow people to record, save and manage their song ideas while being able to track their progress through the project timeline.</p>
            
            <p>I worked on a basic click-through prototype of the current iteration of the application. It requires some fine tweaking and re-designs on most of the pages, but this helped me to gain a better understanding of the flow of the app and realize where I could improve my design.</p>

            <p class="brief">I still need to continue refining my approach in order to exectute it properly, but I feel as if I am getting closer and closer to figuring out the best way to design this approach.</p>
